The Odin Project Full Stack Dev Course

This project works as a storage or a portfolio, if you will, of all my lessons during the "Odin Project" course.

Recipes: First assignment in the course, to learn html structure. I've learned to use various features like images, links to other pages and somewhat formatted text and lists.
         The pasta image in the bolognese recipe was taken from google images under the Creative Commons license.
         Up next we'll dive into the CSS portion of the Fundamentals course.

By now, I have completed the intro to CSS part of the course. 
I went through learning about properties to apply to html elements, how to apply them (externally, internally and in-line). 
I also learned about classes, IDs and how to use them efficiently.
